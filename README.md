* MY PROGRAMMING JOURNEY -:
  Previously at first time i learned about cmd in class 5. that is when i was inspired about programming . 
  Firstly i was intrested in hacking and of course everybody wants to become a hacker . 
  But in time i didnt get limited resources for learning hacking so i quit it . 
  Then i learned about batch files and so on . my first program was infinite loop of random number generator in batch file .
  Then i was more intrested in this types of things 
  After that i learned html and css but i was stucked in javascript.
  Then i learned about c++ basic codes and then i realize it was hard.
  My main mistake was to switch from one platform to another without learning about them 
  I tried other platforms like UNITY Game Engine :
      ! where i make my first game in unity called brickbreaker.
      ! that was when i realize that making game is lot a hard work. i also learned about effective way to use functions . 
      ! then i made some other 2d games.
      ! i feel like i was still incomplete so i leave this platform and shift to python and started from Scratch.
